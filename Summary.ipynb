    "### Introduction\n",
    "Percentage of body fat of an individual can be estimated by body density which can be given by an underwater weighing technique. However, the process of determining the body density is difficult. With the given data set, we aim at examining the relationships between Percentage of Body fat and commonly available measurements. The results of analysis show that the percentage of body fat of American Men is negative related with Height and Wrist, positive related with Abdomen size and Age."

The 16 variables are Percentage of body fat(%), Body density from underwater weighing (gm/cm^3), Age (year), Weight (lbs), Height (inches), BMI(kg/m^2) and ten Body Circumferences (Neck, Chest, Abdomen, Hip, Thigh, Knee, Ankle, Biceps, Forearm, Wrist, all in units of cm).

    "The percentage of body fat is usually estimated by body density, while it is difficult to measure the density by underwater submersion . For doctors, a quick and easy way, though not so accurate way is practical. The commonly available measurements are closely related to %bodyfat and can be obtained readily. Therefore we intend to build a model estimating %bodyfat based on these measurements. And for simplicity, we choose linear model which is simple and easy to use. Since the density is hard to estimated, we keep it aside from the liner regression model."

    "### Discussion of Model\n",
    "#### Strengths\n",
    "- Linearity: Scatterplots of Bodyfat against each of the predictors are reasonably straight. And the The residuals appear to be randomly scattered and have no pattern with respect to the predicted values, which indicates that we capture the linearity and there is no non-linear relation between %bodyfat and predictors.\n",
    "- Simplicity: The final model only has 4 predictors. To estimate body fat percentage of a man, we only need to access age, height, circumferences of abdomen and wrist. All of the measurements are easy to obtain.\n",
    "- The final model conform to our experience, which will be further discussed in the conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weakness\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: The scale-location plot shows that the variation of %bodyfat seems to be less when fitted values get larger.\n",
    "- Normality: According to the qq-plot of residuals, it is suspected that the normal distribution is light-tailed.\n",
    "- Precision: Our practical methods have a 3% to 4% error factor in the prediction of body fat.\n",
    "- Restriction: Since the dataset is observed from American men, the conclusion will not be that accurate when it is used for women. The problem can be solved by scaling.\n",
    "- There may be non-linear relationships between bodyfat and circumferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible rule of thumb\n",
    "Your height times -0.3, plus abdomen circumference times 0.7, plus wrist circumference times -1.8, plus age times 0.05 and then add 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "For a man aged 30 with 73 inches height, 90 cm abdomen Cir. and 17 cm wrist Cir., his predicted body fat % percentage would be around 17.87%. With the rule of thumb, we get about 16% as the predicted body fat %."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The estimated regression equation is simplified as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\% Body\\ Fat} =  4.05 -0.29*Height + 0.71*Abdomen -1.79*Wrist + 0.05*Age$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $R^2$ for the regression is 73%. Height, abdomen and forearm and wrist size together account for about 72.5% of the variation in %body fat among men. The regression equation indicates the underlying interpretation:\n",
    "- The positive intercept of the regression model proves a simple fact: body fat will always exist.\n",
    "- Each pound in height is associated with about a 0.3 decrease in %body fat among men.\n",
    "- Each centimeter of abdomen is associated with a increase in %body fat of about 0.7 among men.\n",
    "- Each centimeter of wrist is associated with a increase in %body fat of about 1.8 among men.\n",
    "- The increase of age will in general lead to the decrease in %body fat of about 0.05. \n",
    "\n",
    "Len Kravit assumed a two-component model of body composition divides the body into a fat component and fat-free component. He also figured out for men, abdomen is classfied as a good measurement for bodyfat, while wrist is considered as a fat-free component. Increasing age can also lead to reduced metabolism and increased % body fat. Thus the signs of coefficients seem to be reasonable. Furthermore, it's hard to solve the multicollinearity between circumferences and height, therefore the negative effect of height on body fat is an outcome of confounding."
